# Builders' Stack

Hey! This repo runs on a multi-agent Claude Code workflow. The short
version: **smart expensive models do the thinking, fast cheap models do the
typing, and everything lives in files** — so any person or agent can pick up
exactly where the last one stopped.

## How it works (30 seconds)

```
idea ──/pm──▶ spec ──/plan──▶ plan ──/build──▶ code ──/qa──▶ verdict
        Opus          Opus           Sonnet          Sonnet
```

Three entry points, picked by ambiguity — ceremony is spent where
ambiguity lives: `/fix` (XS mechanical — straight to a builder), `/plan`
(clear S/M ask — **the everyday default**: the planner writes a mini-spec
into the plan, no PM hop), `/pm` (ambiguous or large — the full line
above).

- **Opus** (or Fable) writes the spec and the step-by-step plan — all the
  decisions get made here.
- **Sonnet** implements the plan literally and reviews the result — no
  improvising, no "creative" architecture at 2am.
- If anything's ambiguous, the workflow **asks you** instead of guessing.
  If you overrule a rule, it notes the trade-off and gets out of your way.

## Try it

```
/fix dead link in the README                  # XS lane: builder direct, reviewer after
/plan add retry to the fetch client           # default lane: Opus plans, Sonnet builds
/ship add fuzzy matching to merchant search   # triaged pipeline, one shot
/status                                       # what's going on right now
```

Or run the stages yourself: `/plan <desc>` → `/build <task-id>` →
`/qa <task-id>` (prepend `/pm` when the "what" needs deciding).

## Where things live

| You want... | Look at... |
|---|---|
| The rules | `CLAUDE.md` (agents read this first, you should too) |
| What's in flight | `.claude/state/index.md` — every task, one line each |
| What the code does | `.claude/context/codemap.md` — map, not the territory |
| Why we did X | `.claude/context/decisions.md` — the ADR log |
| What went wrong & what we learned | `.claude/state/learnings.md` — agents log their own misses |
| A task's full story | `.claude/state/tasks/<id>/` — spec, plan, progress, review |

## Working with others (or just future-you)

Every task gets its own branch (`task/<id>`) and one owner at a time. Agents
push after every step, so if a laptop dies or a session ends, the next one
loses at most one step. Claims older than ~2 hours without a push are fair
game for takeover. Solo? Same flow, you can just skip the PR formality
(there's an ADR for that).

## Before your first real task

Fill in the TODOs in `.claude/context/product.md`, `architecture.md`, and
the test/lint commands in `conventions.md`. The planners are only as good
as what's in those files — garbage in, expensive garbage out.

**Adopting mid-project?** Run `/adopt` — Opus reads the codebase and
drafts all four context files plus the code map for you to confirm,
merging around anything you already wrote. In-flight branches and PRs
join the index as lanes touch them — no big-bang migration.
